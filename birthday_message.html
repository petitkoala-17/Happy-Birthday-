I wish for you, in this new year, to achieve all the goals you set, even exceeding them. For the lives of the kids you coach, your friends, and family, I wish you always have a positive impact. Even though I "wish" this, I have no doubt it will be the case, given the qualities you possess: your strong-will, kind heart and beautiful soul, among many others.
                        No matter the challenges that may arise, I wish for you to find the strength to overcome them, as challenges are meant to build. I hope you keep growing positively in all areas of life, nurturing those around you to grow as well, creating beautiful memories and amazing stories to tell.
